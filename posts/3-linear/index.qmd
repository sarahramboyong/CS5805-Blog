# Introduction

Regression is a statitical method that allows on to predict the output of one variables based on the input of another. It is a way of quantifying the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and one or more independent variables (X).

There are two types of regression: linear and non-linear. Linear regression uses one independent variable to predict the outcome of the dependent variable. It follows the equation: $y=mx+b$ where m is the slope, or the rate of change, and b is the intercept.


Non-linear regression is used when there is a relationship between the dependent variable and more than one indepent variables. It follows the equation:

Non-linear regression, or multi-linear regression, accounts for the majority of real-life data which are complex and often influences b

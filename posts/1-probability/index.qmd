This blog will be all about probability theory & random variables.... maybe histograms?

We could write about predicting probabiliyt an dhow it has to add to 1?


We will be using the Diabetes dataset from sklearn. This dataset contains 442 total samples with 10 different features: 
* age
* sex
* body mass index (BMI)
* average blood pressure
* total serum chloesterol
* low-density lipoproteins
* total cholesterol
* possibly log of serum triglycerides level
* blood sugar level

This dataset is publically avaliable through the sklearn package with [documentation avaliable].(https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes.html)


This dataset is publically avaliable through the [StatLib archive].(https://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston)

We will also be using the Auto MPG dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to explore non-linear relationships. This dataset contains 398 samples and information on vehicle mpg, number of cylinders, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, origin, name, and displacement. This dataset is publically avaliable on [The UCI Machine Learning Repository Website](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/9/auto+mpg).
